# Clip Search Webpage

This website allows visitors to directly access neurons contained in the convolutional neural network (CNN) Resnet-50. Webpage can be found [here](https://dr4nx.github.io/clip-search/index.html).

Users can either search through individual neurons or by searching various concepts (e.g. stripes, blue, zebra). The webpage will then return that neuron's top activating images and those images' similarity to different concepts.

Website coded in standard HTML/CSS/JS.
